# Scriberr

This is Scriberr, a self-hostable AI audio transcription app. Scriberr uses the open-source [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) models from OpenAI,
to transcribe audio files locally on your hardware. It uses the [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) high-performance inference engine
for OpenAI's Whisper. Scriberr also allows you to summarize transcripts using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, with your own custom prompts.

## Features
- Fast transcription with support for hardware acceleration across a wide variety of platforms
- Customizable compute settings. Choose #threads, #cores and your model size
- Transcription happens locally on device
- Exposes API endpoints for automation pipelines and integrating with other tools
- Optionally summarize transcripts with ChatGPT
- Use your own custom prompts for summarization
- Mobile ready
- Simple & Easy to use

and more to come. Checkout the planned features section.

## Demo and Screenshots

> [!note]
> Demo was run locally on my Macbook Air M2 using docker.
> Performance depends on the size of the model used and also
> number of cores and threads you assign.  Was running a lot of things in the background and this is in dev mode so it's really slow.

## Installation

Scriberr can be deployed using Docker. Use the docker-compose shown below with your configuration values.

```yaml
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:beta
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "8080:8080" #Optionally expose DB UI
      - "9243:9243" #Optionally expose JobQueue UI
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=<reallylongsecretkey>
      - POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
      - REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - SCRIBO_FILES=/scriberr
    volumes:
      - ./pb_data:/app/db
      - ./scriberr_files:/scriberr
```

> [!important]
> On first load, the app will throw a 500 Error because the database collection hasn't been created.

> install.
 
## Planned Features

- Speaker diarization for speaker labels
- Audio recording functionality
- File actions - rename, delete
- Full text fuzzy search
- Tag based organization system
- Follow along text with playback
- Edit summaries
- Export options
- Support for other languages


## Known Bugs
- First app load will fail due to missing database. Reloading will fix it.
- Requires page refresh to load audio for newly transcribed files
- Automatic update of processed files is finicky and might require a page refresh for update

## Note
This is a beta app in development, so expect a few rough edges and minor bugs. The app is functional
and should for the most part be usable barring the need to refresh the page at times for the UI to
update state.

If you like this project I would really appreciate it if you could star this repository.
