# Scriberr - Self-hosted AI Transcription App

## About
Scriberr is a self-hostable AI audio transcription app. It leverages the open-source [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) models from OpenAI, utilizing the high-performance [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) transcription engine to transcribe audio files locally on your hardware. Scriberr also allows you to summarize transcripts using Ollama or OpenAI's ChatGPT API, with your own custom prompts. From v0.2.0, Scriberr supports offline speaker diarization with significant improvements.

**Note**: This app is under active development, and this release includes **breaking changes**. You will lose your old data. Please read the installation instructions carefully.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **NVIDIA GPU** (optional): If you plan to use GPU acceleration, ensure you have an NVIDIA GPU and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.
- **HuggingFace API Key** (required for speaker diarization): You'll need a free API key from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) to download diarization models.

### Quick Start

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishikanthc/Scriberr.git
cd Scriberr
```

#### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example `.env` file and adjust the settings as needed:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to set your desired configuration, including:

- **`ADMIN_USERNAME`** and **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** for accessing the web interface.
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** if you plan to use OpenAI's GPT models for summarization.
- **`HARDWARE_ACCEL`** set to `gpu` if you have an NVIDIA GPU.
- Other configurations as needed.

#### Running with Docker Compose (CPU Only)

To run Scriberr without GPU acceleration:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command uses the `docker-compose.yml` file and builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.

#### Running with Docker Compose (GPU Support)

To run Scriberr with GPU acceleration:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
```

This command uses both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.gpu.yml` files and builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile-gpu`.

**Note**: Ensure that you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed and properly configured.

#### Access the Application

Once the containers are up and running, access the Scriberr web interface at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in the `.env` file).

### Building Docker Images Manually

If you wish to build the Docker images yourself, you can use the provided `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-gpu`.

#### CPU Image

```bash
docker build -t scriberr:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

#### GPU Image

```bash
docker build -t scriberr:latest-gpu -f Dockerfile-cuda128 .
```

### Advanced Configuration

The application can be customized using the following environment variables in your `.env` file.

- **`ADMIN_USERNAME`**: Username for the admin user in the web interface.
- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: Password for the admin user.
- **`AI_MODEL`**: Default model to use for summarization (e.g., `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`).
- **`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`**: Base URL of your OpenAI API-compatible server if not using OpenAI (e.g., your Ollama server).
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Your OpenAI API key if using OpenAI for summarization (Or Ollama if `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` is set)
- **`DIARIZATION_MODEL`**: Default model for speaker diarization (e.g., `"pyannote/speaker-diarization@3.1"`).
- **`MODELS_DIR`**, **`WORK_DIR`**, **`AUDIO_DIR`**: Directories for models, temporary files, and uploads.
- **`BODY_SIZE_LIMIT`**: Maximum request body size (e.g., `"1G"`).
- **`HARDWARE_ACCEL`**: Set to `gpu` for GPU acceleration (NVIDIA GPU required), defaults to `cpu`.

#### Speaker Diarization Setup

##### Required Models
The application requires access to the following Hugging Face models:

* pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
* pyannote/segmentation-3.0
###### Setup Steps
1. Create a free account at HuggingFace if you don’t already have one.
2. Generate an API token at HuggingFace Tokens.
3. Accept user conditions for the required models on Hugging Face:
    - Visit pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 and accept the conditions.
    - Visit pyannote/segmentation-3.0 and accept the conditions.
4. Enter the API token in the setup wizard when prompted. The token is only used during initial setup and is not stored permanently.
Storage and Usage


The diarization models are downloaded once and stored locally, so you won’t need to provide the API key again after the initial setup.


### Updating from Previous Versions

**Important**: This release includes **breaking changes** and is **not backward compatible** with previous versions. You will lose your existing data. Please back up your data before proceeding.

Changes include:

- **Performance Improvements**: The rewrite takes advantage of Svelte 5 reactivity features.
- **Transcription Engine Change**: Switched from Whisper.cpp to **WhisperX**.
- **Improved Diarization**: Significant improvements to the diarization pipeline.
- **Simplified Setup**: Streamlined setup process with improved wizard.
- **New UI**: Implemented a new UI design with glassmorphism.
- **Multilingual Support**: Transcription and diarization now support all languages that Whisper models support.

### Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure that the PostgreSQL container is running and accessible.
- **GPU Not Detected**: Ensure that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed and that Docker is configured correctly.
- **Permission Issues**: Running Docker commands may require root permissions or being part of the `docker` group.
- **Diarization Model Download Failure**: Make sure you've entered a valid HuggingFace API key during setup.
- **CUDA failed with error out of memory**: Ensure that your GPU has enough memory to run the models. You can try reducing the batch size by adding WHISPER_BATCH_SIZE= to your .env file. The default is 16, you can reduce to 8, 4, 2, etc. (Got large-v2 running on a 1.5 hour audio file on a 3070 with 8GB VRAM using batch size of 1. Anything higher and it died.)

Check the logs for more details:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
