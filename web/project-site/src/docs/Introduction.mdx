At its core, Scriberr allows you to transcribe audio and video locally on your machine, ensuring no data is ever sent to a third-party cloud provider.
Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models (such as **Whisper**, **NVIDIA Parakeet**, and **Canary**), it delivers high-accuracy text with word-level timing.

Scriberr goes beyond simple transcription and provides various advanced capabilities.
It combines powerful under-the-hood AI with a polished, fluid user interface that makes managing your recordings feel effortless. Whether you are sorting through voice notes or analyzing long meetings, Scriberr provides a beautiful environment to get work done:

- **Smart Speaker Detection**: It doesn’t just output a block of text—Scriberr automatically detects different speakers (Diarization) and labels exactly who said what.
- **Chat with your Audio**: Connect seamlessly with Ollama or OpenAI. You can generate summaries, ask questions, or have a full conversation with your transcripts right inside the app.
- **Built for your Workflow**: With extensive APIs and a clever "File Watcher" that automatically processes new files in a folder, Scriberr fits right into your existing automations (like n8n).
- **Capture & Organize**: Use the built-in audio recorder to capture thoughts on the fly, and use the integrated note-taking features to annotate your transcripts as you listen.
- **Native Experience everywhere**: Scriberr supports PWA (Progressive Web App) installation, giving you a native app experience on your desktop or mobile device.
- **A Polished UI**: From dark mode to smooth animations, I’ve focused on the little UI niceties that make the app feel responsive and satisfying to use.

## Why I built this

The inspiration for Scriberr was born out of privacy paranoia not wanting to pay for subscription.
About a year ago, I purchased a [Plaud Note](https://www.plaud.ai/) for recording voice memos. I loved the device itself; the form factor, microphone quality, and workflow were excellent.

However, transcription was done on their cloud servers. As someone who is paranoid about privacy I wasn't comfortable with uploading my recordings to a third party provider.
Moreover I was hit with subscription costs: $100 a year for 20 hours of transcription per month, or $240 a year for unlimited access. As an avid self-hoster with a background in ML and AI, it felt wrong to pay such a premium for a service I knew I could engineer myself.

I decided to build Scriberr to bridge that gap, creating a powerful, private, and free alternative for everyone.
