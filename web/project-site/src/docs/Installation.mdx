# Installation

Get Scriberr running on your system in a few minutes.

## Install with Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

The easiest way to install Scriberr is using Homebrew. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, [get it here first](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
# Add the Scriberr tap
brew tap rishikanthc/scriberr

# Install Scriberr (automatically installs UV dependency)
brew install scriberr

# Start the server
scriberr
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Configuration

Scriberr works out of the box. To customize settings, create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Server settings
HOST=localhost
PORT=8080

# Data storage (optional)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/scriberr.db
UPLOAD_DIR=./data/uploads
WHISPERX_ENV=./data/whisperx-env

# Custom paths (if needed)
UV_PATH=/custom/path/to/uv
```

## Docker Deployment

For a containerized setup, you can use Docker. We provide two configurations: one for standard CPU usage and one optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA).

### Standard Deployment (CPU)

Use this configuration for running Scriberr on any machine without a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.

1.  Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  scriberr_data:
```

2.  Run the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### NVIDIA GPU Deployment (CUDA)

If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU, this configuration enables hardware acceleration for significantly faster transcription.

1.  Ensure you have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.
2.  Create a file named `docker-compose.cuda.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:v1.0.4-cuda
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities:
                - gpu
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility

volumes:
  scriberr_data: {}
```

3.  Run the container with the CUDA configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.cuda.yml up -d
```
