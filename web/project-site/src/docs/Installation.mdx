# Installation

Get Scriberr running on your system in a few minutes.

## Install with Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

The easiest way to install Scriberr is using Homebrew. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, [get it here first](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
# Add the Scriberr tap
brew tap rishikanthc/scriberr

# Install Scriberr (automatically installs UV dependency)
brew install scriberr

# Start the server
scriberr
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Configuration

Scriberr works out of the box. However, for Homebrew or manual installations, you can customize the application behavior using environment variables or a `.env` file placed in the same directory as the binary (or where you run the command from).

> **Docker Users:** You can ignore this section if you are using `docker-compose.yml`, as these values are set in the `environment` section there.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | The port the server listens on. | `8080` |
| `HOST` | The interface to bind to. | `0.0.0.0` |
| `APP_ENV` | Application environment (`development` or `production`). | `development` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS allowed origins (comma separated). | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080` |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to the SQLite database file. | `data/scriberr.db` |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | Directory for storing uploaded files. | `data/uploads` |
| `TRANSCRIPTS_DIR` | Directory for storing transcripts. | `data/transcripts` |
| `WHISPERX_ENV` | Path to the managed Python environment for models. | `data/whisperx-env` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API Key for OpenAI (optional). | `""` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWTs. Auto-generated if not set. | Auto-generated |

**Example `.env` file:**

```bash
# Server settings
HOST=localhost
PORT=8080
APP_ENV=production

# Paths
DATABASE_PATH=/var/lib/scriberr/data/scriberr.db
UPLOAD_DIR=/var/lib/scriberr/data/uploads

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this
```

## Docker Deployment

For a containerized setup, you can use Docker. We provide two configurations: one for standard CPU usage and one optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA).

### Standard Deployment (CPU)

Use this configuration for running Scriberr on any machine without a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.

1.  Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  scriberr_data:
```

2.  Run the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### NVIDIA GPU Deployment (CUDA)

If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU, this configuration enables hardware acceleration for significantly faster transcription.

1.  Ensure you have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.
2.  Create a file named `docker-compose.cuda.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:v1.0.4-cuda
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities:
                - gpu
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility

volumes:
  scriberr_data: {}
```

3.  Run the container with the CUDA configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.cuda.yml up -d
```
