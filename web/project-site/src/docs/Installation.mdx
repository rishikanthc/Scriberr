# Installation

Get Scriberr running on your system in a few minutes.

## Migrating from v1.1.0

If you are upgrading from v1.1.0, please follow these steps to ensure a smooth transition. Version 1.2.0 introduces a separation between application data (database, uploads) and model data (Python environments).

### 1. Update Volume Mounts

You will need to update your Docker volume configuration to split your data:

*   **Application Data:** Bind your existing data folder (containing `scriberr.db`, `jwt_secret`, `transcripts/`, and `uploads/`) to `/app/data`.
*   **Model Environment:** Create a **new, empty folder** and bind it to `/app/whisperx-env`.

### 2. Clean Up Old Environments

> **CRITICAL:** You must delete any existing `whisperx-env` folder from your previous installation.

The Python environment and models need to be reinitialized for v1.2.0. If the application detects an old environment, it may attempt to use it, leading to compatibility errors. Starting with a fresh `/app/whisperx-env` volume ensures the correct dependencies are installed.

## Install with Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

The easiest way to install Scriberr is using Homebrew. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, [get it here first](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
# Add the Scriberr tap
brew tap rishikanthc/scriberr

# Install Scriberr (automatically installs UV dependency)
brew install scriberr

# Start the server
scriberr
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Configuration

Scriberr works out of the box. However, for Homebrew or manual installations, you can customize the application behavior using environment variables or a `.env` file placed in the same directory as the binary (or where you run the command from).

> **Docker Users:** You can ignore this section if you are using `docker-compose.yml`, as these values are already configured with sane defaults.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | The port the server listens on. | `8080` |
| `HOST` | The interface to bind to. | `0.0.0.0` |
| `APP_ENV` | Application environment (`development` or `production`). | `development` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS allowed origins (comma separated). | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080` |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to the SQLite database file. | `data/scriberr.db` |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | Directory for storing uploaded files. | `data/uploads` |
| `TRANSCRIPTS_DIR` | Directory for storing transcripts. | `data/transcripts` |
| `WHISPERX_ENV` | Path to the managed Python environment for models. | `data/whisperx-env` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API Key for OpenAI (optional). | `""` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWTs. Auto-generated if not set. | Auto-generated |

**Example `.env` file:**

```bash
# Server settings
HOST=localhost
PORT=8080
APP_ENV=production

# Paths
DATABASE_PATH=/var/lib/scriberr/data/scriberr.db
UPLOAD_DIR=/var/lib/scriberr/data/uploads

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this
```

## Docker Deployment

For a containerized setup, you can use Docker. We provide two configurations: one for standard CPU usage and one optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA).

> **Permissions:** Ensure you set the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables to your host user's UID and GID (typically `1000` on Linux) to avoid permission issues with the SQLite database. You can find your UID/GID by running `id` on your host.
>
> **HTTP vs HTTPS:** By default, Scriberr enables **Secure Cookies** in production. If you are accessing the app via plain HTTP (not HTTPS), you MUST set `SECURE_COOKIES=false` in your environment variables, otherwise you will encounter "Unable to load audio stream" errors.

### Standard Deployment (CPU)

Use this configuration for running Scriberr on any machine without a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.

1.  Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr:v1.2.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data # volume for data
      - env_data:/app/whisperx-env # volume for models and python envs
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID:-1000}
      - PGID=${PGID:-1000}
      - APP_ENV=production # DO NOT CHANGE THIS
      # CORS: comma-separated list of allowed origins for production
      # - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
      # - SECURE_COOKIES=false # Uncomment this ONLY if you are not using SSL
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  scriberr_data: {}
  env_data: {}
```

2.  Run the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### NVIDIA GPU Deployment (CUDA)

If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU, this configuration enables hardware acceleration for significantly faster transcription.

1.  Ensure you have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.
2.  Create a file named `docker-compose.cuda.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  scriberr:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/scriberr-cuda:v1.2.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - scriberr_data:/app/data # volume for data
      - env_data:/app/whisperx-env # volume for models and python envs
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities:
                - gpu
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility
      - PUID=${PUID:-1000}
      - PGID=${PGID:-1000}
      - APP_ENV=production # DO NOT CHANGE THIS
      # CORS: comma-separated list of allowed origins for production
      # - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
      # - SECURE_COOKIES=false # Uncomment this ONLY if you are not using SSL

volumes:
  scriberr_data: {}
  env_data: {}
```

3.  Run the container with the CUDA configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.cuda.yml up -d
```

## App Startup

When you run Scriberr for the first time, it may take several minutes to start. This is normal!

The application needs to initialize the Python environments and download the necessary machine learning models (NVIDIA Sortformer, NVIDIA Canary, NVIDIA Parakeet).

**Subsequent runs will be much faster** because all models and environments are persisted to the `env_data` volume (or your local mapped folders).

You will know the application is ready when you see the line: `msg="Scriberr is ready" url=http://0.0.0.0:8080`.
