# Diarization

Setting up advanced features like Speaker Diarization.

## Note on Local Execution

> **Docker Users:** If you have configured the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml`, you can ignore the manual token entry steps below. The application will automatically pick it up.
While you need to accept user agreements on Hugging Face to download the models, the actual diarization process happens entirely **locally on your machine**. No audio data is sent to Hugging Face or any third party.

## Speaker Diarization Setup

Scriberr uses [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speaker diarization. To use this feature, you need to obtain an access token from Hugging Face.

### Step 1: Hugging Face Account

If you don't have one, create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join).

### Step 2: Accept User Agreements

Visit the following model pages and accept the user agreements for each:

* [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.0)
* [pyannote/speaker-diarization](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization)
* [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1)
* [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0)
* [pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)

### Step 3: Create Access Token

You will need to get a Hugging Face access token.
1. Go to your Hugging Face [Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/token).
2. Create a new token with at least `read` access.
3. Configure the token using one of these methods:
   - **Environment Variable:** Set `HF_TOKEN` (recommended for Docker deployments)
   - **UI Input:** Paste the token in the Diarization settings within your transcription profile
