# Usage Guide

## 1. Uploading Files
Getting media into Scriberr is simple. You can drag and drop files directly onto the homepage, or use the **`+`** button in the top navigation bar to open the upload menu.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-6">
    <BrowserFrame className="my-0">
        <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/upload-menu.png" alt="Upload Menu" className="w-full" />
    </BrowserFrame>
     <BrowserFrame className="my-0">
        <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/drag-and-drop.png" alt="Drag and Drop" className="w-full" />
    </BrowserFrame>
</div>

**Supported Upload Methods:**

* **File Picker:** Upload standard audio or video files from your device.
* **Quick Transcribe:** Upload a file and immediately start processing (ephemeral mode).
* **YouTube:** Paste a video URL to download and transcribe it directly.
* **Audio Recorder:** Record voice notes directly within the browser.
* **Multi-track Project:** Upload Audacity (`.aup`) project files to handle multi-track recordings (one file per speaker).

## 2. Transcribing Audio
Once a file is uploaded, it appears as a recording card on your homepage. You can start a transcription job in two ways:

<BrowserFrame>

</BrowserFrame>

### Starting a Job
* **On Desktop:** Hover over the recording card to reveal the action buttons.
    * **Magic Wand 🪄:** Starts a transcription immediately using your default **Profile** (Recommended).
    * **Magic Wand + 🪄➕:** Opens the **Advanced Parameters** dialog, allowing you to tweak settings specific to this one job.
* **On Mobile:** Swipe left on the recording card to reveal these options.

### Transcription Profiles
Profiles allow you to save your favorite settings (like language, model size, or prompt) as presets.

<BrowserFrame>
    <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/settings-transcription.png" alt="Transcription Settings" className="w-full" />
</BrowserFrame>

1. Go to **Settings > Transcription**.
2. Click **Create New Profile**.
3. Adjust your parameters and save.
4. (Optional) Mark a profile as "Default" to use it for all quick actions.

### Automatic Transcription
If you prefer a hands-off approach, you can enable **Auto-transcribe on Upload** in the *Settings > Transcription* tab. Scriberr will automatically process every new file using your default profile.

### Speaker Diarization
To distinguish between different speakers in your transcript:

1. Ensure **Speaker Diarization** is enabled in your Profile or Advanced settings.
2. **Note:** This requires a Hugging Face API key and acceptance of user conditions for the requested models (PyAnnote or NVIDIA Sortformer). Please refer to the [Diarization Page](/docs/diarization) for setup details.

## 3. The Transcript View
Clicking on a recording card opens the full Transcript View. Here you can read, listen, and manage your content.

<BrowserFrame>
    <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/transcript-actions.png" alt="Transcript View" className="w-full" />
</BrowserFrame>

### Playback & Navigation
* **Timeline vs. Compact:** Toggle between a time-coded view (showing segments and speaker labels) and a compact text view using the view switcher.
* **Click-to-Seek:**
    * **Desktop:** Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Click` on any word to jump the audio to that exact moment.
    * **Mobile:** Highlight text and select **Listen** from the popup menu.

### Taking Notes
You can annotate your transcript while listening.

* **How to Note:** Highlight any text in the transcript to reveal the popup menu, then select **Add Note**.
* **View Notes:** Click the **Action Menu (⋮)** (top right) and select **Notes** to see a list of all annotations for the file.

### Managing the Recording
Use the **Action Menu (⋮)** at the top right of the page to:

<BrowserFrame>
    <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/transcript-actions.png" alt="Actions Menu" className="w-full" />
</BrowserFrame>

* Download the transcript (JSON, SRT, TXT).
* View execution logs and technical info.
* Rename the recording (or simply click the title to edit).

## 4. AI & LLM Features
Scriberr can connect to an LLM to Summarize or Chat with your audio.

### Configuration
Before using these features, go to **Settings > LLM**:

<BrowserFrame>
    <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/settings-llm.png" alt="LLM Settings" className="w-full" />
</BrowserFrame>

1. **Select Provider:** Choose between **Ollama** (Local) or **OpenAI** (Cloud/API Compatible).
2. **OpenAI Compatible:** If using a non-OpenAI provider (like a local server mimicking the OpenAI API), enter your custom **Base URL**.

### AI Summaries
To generate summaries, you must first create a **Template** in settings (defined by a Name and a System Prompt). Once configured, select **Summarize** from the Action Menu inside a transcript.

### Chat with Transcript
You can have an interactive conversation with your audio (e.g., "What were the main action items discussed?").

1. Click the **Chat Icon** 💬 at the top right of the transcript page.
2. Click **`+`** to start a new session.
3. Select your desired model and start chatting.

## 5. Bulk Actions
You can delete or queue transcription for multiple files at once.

<BrowserFrame>
    <img src="/screenshots/usage-guide/bulk-actions-menu.png" alt="Bulk Actions" className="w-full" />
</BrowserFrame>

* **Desktop:** Hold `Shift` + `Click` on a recording to enter bulk mode, then click additional recordings to select them.
* **Mobile:** Long-press on a recording to enter selection mode.

Once items are selected, a floating action bar will appear at the bottom of the screen with your available options.
